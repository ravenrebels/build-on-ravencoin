Docs - how to build on Ravencoin


Let's start with a bunch of questions.
- Will your project only read information from the Ravencoin blockchain?
- Will your project interact with the blockchain? For example transfer assets, mint tokens.
- Will your project use Ravencoin NFTs for authentication, sign in? 
- Do you want to host your own node or do you want to go the easy way and use a service?


# Read information from the Ravencoin blockchain

 
### Host your own Ravencoin node (Raven core node)

You run a full Ravencoin node your self.
You do not trust any service provider, you just trust the blockchain.

Download the software from the "official" GitHub
https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/releases

It can take a day to fully download sync a the blockchain


### Use Ravencoin as a Service
Raven Rebels provide a service that can "kickstart" your development.
